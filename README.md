# Manual QA Testing â€“ OpenLibrary Project

## Overview
This project showcases my manual QA testing skills using the OpenLibrary.org platform, an open-source digital library. I plan to focus on key functionalities available to users.

## Goals
- Practice manual testing techniques on a live web application
- Create and manage bugs using GitHub Issues
- Write clear, structured test cases and test reports using Markdown

## Scope of Testing
WIP: actively exploring the OpenLibrary web app to define the testing scope and to prepare a test plan.

## Deliverables
- Test Cases: Provided in files with the `-test-cases.md` suffix, organized by feature under test.
- Bug Reports: GitHub Issues tab
- Test Plan: `test-plan.md`
- Test Summary Report: separate `test-report.md` file for each test cycle.

## Tools
- GitHub (for test documentation and issue tracking)
- Chrome DevTools (for inspecting bugs)
- Markdown (for documentation)

## Status
In progress. Last updated: June 2025.
